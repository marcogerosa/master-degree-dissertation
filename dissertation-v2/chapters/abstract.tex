We are aware that good codes matter, but how do you know when quality is low? Code smells help us identify problematic code snippets, but most of the code smells cataloged are based on traditional practices and technologies, created from the 1970s through the 90s, such as object oriented and Java. There are still doubts about code smells in technologies that have emerged in the last decade, such as Android, the main mobile platform in 2017 with more than 86\% market share. Some researchers have defined code smells related to Android efficiency and usability. Other research concludes that the components most affected by traditional code smells are related to the front-end, such as \textit{Activities} and \textit{Adapters}. Also noticed in some applications, front-end's codes represent the larger part of the project's code. It is noteworthy that the Android front-end is also composed of XML files, called application resources, used to build user interface (UI), but these files were not considered in their analyzes. In this dissertation, we investigate existence of code smells related to the Android front-end considering even application resources. To aim that performed two online surveys and three experiments summing 3XX developers. Our results show that there is a common perception among practicing Android developers about bad practices on Android front-end. Our main contributions are a catalog of 21 code smells about Android front-end and a statistical analysis of the perceptions of practitioners developers about the main 8 code smells cataloged. Our contributions will serve researchers as a starting point for the definition of heuristics and implementation of automated tools and to practitioners developers as an aid in identifying problematic codes, even manually.
